                                                 *github-theme.changelog-06052023*

I(ful1e5) removed the `dev` configuration from `setup({...})` and added the
`vim.g.github_theme_debug` Vim global option for theme debugging. This option
creates a Lua file in the Neovim cache directory and write debugging logs to
it.

Previously, the `dev` option was used for debugging and assigning new
highlights to the theme, or for overriding defined highlights. Now, with the
removal of the `dev` option, you can override any highlight without enabling
any option.



                                                 *github-theme.changelog-23042023*

The way to override color variables has been updated. You can now use the
|specs| table to change colors for a specific colorscheme or for all of them
with the |all| table. To override highlight groups, use the |groups| table in
the configuration.

Some changes have been made to the names of the colorschemes. You can check
the names of the colorschemes in the "colors" directory in the project root,
or by using the *:colorscheme* vim command.

The deprecated colorschemes will no longer support any overriding highlight
groups or color variables. The updated colorscheme list:

- |github_dark_default|      -> |github_dark_high_contrast|
- |github_dimmed|            -> |github_dark_dimmed|
- |github_light_default|     -> |github_light_high_contrast|
- |github_dark_tritanopia|   -> New!
- |github_light_tritanopia|  -> New!

The updated configuration keys are:
- |colors|    -> Use |specs| and |palettes| instead.
- |overrides| -> Use |groups| instead.

Example:
>lua
  require('github-theme').setup({
    --- ...
    palettes = {
      github_dark = {
        canvas = {
          default = '#000000',
        },
      },
      all = {
        danger = {
          fg = '#FF0000',
        },
      },
    },
    specs = {
      github_dark_dimmed = {
        bg0 = '#111111',
      },
      all = {
        diag = {
          error = '#FF0000',
        },
      },
    },
    groups = {
      github_dark = {
        Error = { fg = '#FF0000' },
      },
      all = {
        ErrorMsg = { link = 'Error' },
      },
    },
  })

  vim.cmd.colorscheme('github_dark_colorblind')

Date: April 13, 2023

The configuration for defining transparency, darkening windows, floating, and
hiding elements has been moved to the *options* table.

The updated configuration keys are as follows:
- |transparent|              -> |options.transparent|
- |hide_end_of_buffer|       -> |options.hide_end_of_buffer|
- |hide_inactive_statusline| -> |options.hide_nc_statusline|
- |dark_float|               -> |options.darken.floats|
- |dark_sidebar|             -> |options.darken.sidebars.enable|
- |sidebars|                 -> |options.darken.sidebars.list|



                                                *github-theme.changelog-12042023*

Date: April 12, 2023

The configuration for defining styles has been migrated to *options.styles*.
As part of this migration, *msg_area_style* has been removed.

Here is the updated config keys:
- |comment_style| -> |options.styles.comments|
- |function_style| -> |options.styles.functions|
- |keyword_style| -> |options.styles.keywords|
- |variable_style| -> |options.styles.variables|
- |msg_area_style| -> Removed.



                                                *github-theme.changelog-11042023*

Date: April 11, 2023

In the |setup| function, the |theme_style| option has been removed, and the
process of setting the colorscheme has been changed, It is important to note
that the configuration may undergo further changes in the future, and will be
described in the latest changelogs and documentation.

Additionally, the currently used colorscheme palettes within the *palette*
module have been given the prefix |'github_'|.

Old approach for setting the theme:
>lua
  require('github-theme').setup({
    theme_style = 'dark',
    --- ...
  })
<
New approach for setting the theme:
>lua
  require('github-theme').setup({
    --- ...
  })

  vim.cmd('colorscheme github_dark')
  -- or
  -- vim.cmd.colorscheme('github_dark')

Date: April 06, 2023

The secondary method of assigning configuration variables using
|'vim.g.github_*'| is now considered deprecated. Instead, it is recommended to
use the |'require("github-theme").setup({...})'| function to assign
configurations.

Any references to the deprecated modules and options can be found in the
documentation located at `:h gt_deprecated.txt`.

PR: https://github.com/projekt0n/github-nvim-theme/pull/222

I (ful1e5) wanted to let you know that we now have support for new treesitter
highlighting groups, thanks to a contribution from |@luisiacc|. If you are
using an older version of treesitter, please switch to the `v0.7` release tag,
which is the last version for you to take advantage of the old treesitter
highlights. We will continue to develop and support these new highlighting
groups going forward.

In addition, I am planning a major refactor of the codebase to make it
compatible with |Neovim-0.9| and will be starting a discussion on GitHub soon.
To ensure that the community is aware of any major changes before they are
implemented, I will provide advance warning before any potentially breaking
changes are pushed to upstream.

This small change is made for differentiate the inactive Statusline and
tabline from the background.

A list of changes that have been made:

- Minimal look deprecated for |lualine|. This deprecation is related to
  `hide_inactive_statusline` option. This means the theme will not force the
  |underline| style to inactive lualine.
- Native lualine theme support terminal highlights |terminal-config|
- Inactive tabline highlights got enhanced.
