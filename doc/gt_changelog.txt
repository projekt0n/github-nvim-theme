I (ful1e5) wanted to let you know that we now have support for new treesitter
highlighting groups, thanks to a contribution from |@luisiacc|. If you are
using an older version of treesitter, please switch to the `v0.6` release tag,
which is the last version for you to take advantage of the old treesitter
highlights. We will continue to develop and support these new highlighting
groups going forward.

In addition, I am planning a major refactor of the codebase to make it
compatible with |Neovim-0.9| and will be starting a discussion on GitHub soon.
To ensure that the community is aware of any major changes before they are
implemented, I will provide advance warning before any potentially breaking
changes are pushed to upstream.

This small change is made for differentiate the inactive Statusline and
tabline from the background.

A list of changes that have been made:

- Minimal look deprecated for |lualine|.
    This deprecation is related to `hide_inactive_statusline` option. This
    means the theme will not force the |underline| style to inactive lualine.
- Native lualine theme support terminal highlights |terminal-config|
- Inactive tabline highlights got enhanced.
